ASM

- Near and Far in procedures how are they used exactly?
- Is it a good idea to push every register modified by a procedure. Maybe there are more efficient alternatives? In particular do I really need to push ax?
- Figure out how to add debug information to the build.
- How does the LEA opcode works exactly?
- Do I need to create a stack segment for a com file? Will DOS put the SP at a lower address if there is not enough memory?
- Is masm only accepting 8086 instructions? Maybe I can send a flag during assembly just in case?

- How do I check before setting the video mode that the desire mode is supported?
