ASM
---
- Near and Far in procedures how are they used exactly?
- Is it a good idea to push every register modified by a procedure. Maybe there are more efficient alternatives? In particular do I really need to push ax?
- Figure out how to add debug information to the build.
- How does the LEA opcode works exactly?
- Do I need to create a stack segment for a com file? Will DOS put the SP at a lower address if there is not enough memory? How does DOS make sure in general there is enough memory to run the game?
- Is masm only accepting 8086 instructions? Maybe I can send a flag during assembly just in case?
- Is there an assert directive I can use?

IBM PC
------
- How do I check before setting the video mode that the desire mode is supported?
- When I call a BIOS or DOS interrupt what registers can I expect to be saved?
- Color 3 in Palette 0 can be brown or yellow, apparently. What decides that exactly?
- Make sure I understand which version of DOS is required to run the game.
- See if I can find proper documentation on how vsync works.
- Seems like the keypress has to be read before quitting, otherwise it will show up in the DOS prompt.
- Should I worry about alignment? The PC and XT will not care about it, because they use an 8088, but newer models do. Probably the code would run fast enough to not care about the penalty?
- I think I read somewhere that the rep prefix will not resume when an interrupt is triggered, meaning the loop will not get completed. Is this true?
- Is there any emulator that produces accurate results for the IBM PC? Otherwise it will be very difficult to measure optmizations.
- What is the difference between BIOS_VIDEO_MODE_320_200_4_COLOR and BIOS_VIDEO_MODE_320_200_4_BW really?
- Added code to detect if you are using a CGA card, but I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it yet.

MASM
----
- Do I need to put the includes as dependencies in the makefile or is there a simple way of dealing with that?
- The makefile doesn't always do the link step after assembling, so it has to be run twice, why is that exactly?
- Is there any way to make the constData segment really const?
